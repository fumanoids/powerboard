 1. INTRODUCTION
-----------------

This board generates two power domains. A 5V domain which can be loaded at 10A
max and a voltage domain in the magnitude of the battery voltage attached 
(6V to 25V). The power supply board is an attempt to create an idiot proof power 
supply board for use in RoboCup scenarios. Many safety measures are implemented. 
In most cases the power supply board prevents the attached electronics from 
failure by monitoring an electronic system state and cutting the power in case
of failure.

 2. VOLTAGE DOMAINS
--------------------

The battery voltage domain can be cut off separately from the battery to lower
power consumption or to prevent electronic damage in that domain in case of a 
power failure. It is possible to attach a switch to cut the power on that domain
manually. This domain is monitored by a processor and can be controlled by 
software as well. The processor distributes information about the state of this
domain in an interval of about 50ms. 

The 5V domain is generated by a high performance step down voltage converter 
operating at above 90% efficiency thus reducing heat production in high current
environments. In case of a power failure (short circuit) in this domain the 
power board can cut off the battery switching the entire system off.
The board can turn off the 5V domain and signal a power failure to the user.

 3. PROCESSOR
--------------

An ARM CorexM0 processor is integrated in the board to monitor the voltages and
currents and reports the system state to any other hardware.
The software on the processor can be changed easily and even on-chip-debugged. 
The processor communicates via a 3.3V serial interface (UART) and can be 
configured for use in multiple enviroments.
With the communication some behavior can be triggered like switching the robot
off or configuring thresholds where the power shall be cut off automatically.

For the documentation/manuals of the processors please consider visiting
the manufacturers homepage (http://www.st.com/).

 3. USER BUTTONS/SWITCHES
--------------------------

Two buttons and a switch can be connected to the board in order to turn the 
power on, to turn the power off and to power off the battery voltage domain.
The power on and off buttons need to be pressed for a very brief moment and
overrule any software decision (power on powers on; power off powers off!).
The off switch for the battery voltage domain overrules any software setting, 
too. This can be used to shut down the servo motors, for example.
The processor distributes information about the state of the switch to attached
systems.

To connect the buttons and the switch four wires are needed:
A ground wire goes to every button / switch and another goes back to the board.
The wire going back does not carry any defined voltage or load. Treat those 
signals as high ohmic. A drop in the resistance to ground acts as "pressed".
This feature leads to robustness if a wire is broken and touches another 
electronic part.
